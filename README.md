# Distributed tracing demo with Zipkin and Flask

## Demo Request Flow

![](docs/Request Flow.png)

```
User
    -> Service 1
        -> Service 2
            -> Service 3
        -> Service 3
```

## Notes

* Don't use [flask-zipkin](https://github.com/qiajigou/flask-zipkin). It's unmaintained, uses outdated reqs, and has unresolved bugs.
    * Use [py_zipkin](https://github.com/Yelp/py_zipkin/) instead
* The request headers being passed are currently hardcoded based on the order of the services, you could instead define a list of headers to pass when they exist
    * This has pros and cons â€” consider your context

## Running the Demo

### Usage

1. `docker-compose up --build`
2. Visit _service 1_: `http://localhost:5001`
